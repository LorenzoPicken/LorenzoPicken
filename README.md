<h1>Hi, my name is Lorenzo</h1>
<br>
<p>A student developper studying video game programming with a passion for all things gaming. I've always loved expressing my creative side and coding has allowed me to expand this to the world of video games. By taking inspiration from some of my favourite games and using the various languages at my disposal like C++, C#, Java, HTML, CSS and  Javascript, I aim to develop awesome titles in which I can infuse some of this creativity and hopefully bring passionate people together, one project at a time. This page is where I'll be showcasing all my work, from games and programs I've worked on to 3D models and concept art in the near future. Below you can find some of my work.</p>
<br>
<p>Here are some games I have been involved with making:</p>
