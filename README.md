<h1>Hi, my name is Lorenzo</h1>
<br>
<p>A junior developer who studied video game programming with a passion for all things gaming. I've always loved expressing my creative side and coding has allowed me to expand this to the world of video games. By taking inspiration from some of my favourite games and using the various languages at my disposal like C#, Java, Python, HTML, CSS and  Javascript / Typescript, I aim to develop awesome titles in which I can infuse some of this creativity and hopefully bring passionate people together, one project at a time. This page is where I'll be showcasing all my work, from games and programs I've worked on to 3D models and concept art in the near future. Below you can find some of my work.</p>
<br>
<p>Here are some games I have been involved with making:</p>
<ul>
  <li>:shield:<a href="https://github.com/JestenAuger/Echos_Of_Fate/tree/Lorenzo's-Branch" target="_blank">Echos of Fate</a></li>
  <li>:black_joker:<a href="https://github.com/LorenzoPicken/Death-Dealt-Hand/tree/Lorenzo's-Branch" target="_blank">Death Dealt Hand</a></li>
  <li>:crossed_swords:<a href="https://github.com/LorenzoPicken/DepthCrawler.git" target="_blank">Depth Crawler</a></li>
  <li>:gun:<a href="https://github.com/LorenzoPicken/Zombie_Shooter/tree/Lorenzo's-Branch" target="_blank">Zombie Shooter</a></li>
</ul>
<br>
<p>
Additionally, I worked as a full-stack developer at Grey-Box on 
<a href="https://www.grey-box.ca/medical-codex/">Project Medical Codex</a>, where I contributed new features to the application 
using <strong>PaddleOCR</strong> and <strong>ClamAV</strong>. These additions allowed the app to extract drug names from images and handle malicious files safely. 
I also enhanced the UI using <strong>React</strong> and <strong>TypeScript</strong>.

<p>If you're into Multiplayer Shooters, I invite you to checkout <a href="https://github.com/JestenAuger/TronArenaBR/tree/main">Project Gridstorm</a>!  A passion project started by a small team of developers including myself, currently in pre-alpha.</p>
